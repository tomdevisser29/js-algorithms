# Breadth-first search

A search algorithm that runs on graphs. It helps answer two kinds of questions:

1. Is there a path between two nodes?
2. What is the shortest path between two nodes?

## Steps

1. You search all the nodes directly connected to the first;
2. For every node that doesn't meet the requirement, add its neighbours to the
   list;

This way you search the entire network of nodes until you find one that meets
the requirement, as long as you search the list in the order in which nodes are
added. The data structure for this is a queue.
