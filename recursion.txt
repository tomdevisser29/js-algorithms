# Recursion

Recursion is when a function calls itself. Every recursive function has two
parts: a base case, which stops the recursion, and a recursive case, which
continues it. Each function call is added to the call stack. If the base case is
missing or the stack gets too deep, you get a stack overflow.

## Tips

- When working with arrays, the base case is often an empty array, or an array
  with one element;
