# Divide and conquer (D&C)

Divide and conquer is a well-known recursive technique for solving problems.

## Steps to follow

To solve a problem using divide and conquer, there are two steps:
1. Figure out the base case, this should be the simplest possible case;
2. Divide or decrease your problem until it becomes the base case.
